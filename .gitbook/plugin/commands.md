## üìú Explanation

* **General Use**: Most of the commands are self-explanatory and are designed to give admins and players control over the teams within your server.
* **Team Creation and Deletion**: Use the `/xteams create` to form a new team and `/xteams delete` to remove one completely. This is vital for maintaining organized and dynamic groups within your server.
* **Joining and Leaving Teams**: The `/xteams join` and `/xteams leave` commands manage player memberships, which allows you to add or remove players to/from teams quickly.
* **Team and Player Information**: For deeper management, the `/xteams teaminfo` and `/xteams playerinfo` commands provide valuable insight into team composition and player statistics.
* **Custom Display Name**: The `/xteams setdisplay` command is a great addition for personalizing your teams, as it allows you add a Display Name instead of using the codename con lists or other places.
