## ðŸ“œ **Explanation**

* **Command Permissions**: Each of the listed commands has an associated permission that controls who can use them. For example, if you want a player to be able to create teams, they need the `xteams.command.create` permission. Similarly, if you want them to be able to delete teams, they need the `xteams.command.delete` permission.
* **Dangerous Permissions:** Some commands include arguments that allow users to manage all players or teams, which can be risky. These permissions should be handled with caution, as they give players the ability to make significant changes that can impact the entire server. For example, the permission `xteams.command.delete.all` enables players to delete all teams with a single command, which could lead to unintended consequences if misused. Always ensure that these permissions are only granted to trusted users or admins.
* **Admin Permission**: The `xteams.admin` permission provides full access to all plugin features and commands. This permission should be reserved for server administrators to prevent unauthorized changes.
